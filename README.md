Welcome to my TwoDue app!
This is a program that supports both mobile, and desktop view.
You can login or create an account as a user. Then, you can create a board and add different tasks within that specific board.
You can complete, edit, remove, and even rearrange your tasks within that specifc board.
As a user, all your info is automatically saved within a DB so you don't have to worry about losing your data!!!
